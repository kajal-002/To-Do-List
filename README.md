Notes Application

This project is a simple web application for taking notes. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes directly in the browser. The notes are stored locally using the browser's local storage feature, allowing users to access their notes even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

Features:

Create Notes: Users can click the "Create Notes" button to create a new note. Each note is represented as a text box with an option to delete it.<br>
Edit Notes: Notes are editable directly in the text boxes. Users can type, format text, and make changes to their notes.<br>
Delete Notes: Each note has a delete button represented by a trash can icon. Clicking this button removes the respective note from the list.<br>
Automatic Saving: The application automatically saves notes in the browser's local storage as they are created or edited. This ensures that users' notes are preserved even if they close the browser.<br>

<br>
File Structure:

index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the notes application.<br>
N.css: CSS file defining the styles and layout of the application.<br>
N.js: JavaScript file containing the logic for creating, editing, and deleting notes, as well as handling local storage operations.<br>

<br>
Usage:

Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.<br>
Open the index.html file in a web browser to launch the notes application.<br>
Click the "Create Notes" button to add new notes, edit existing notes by clicking on them, and delete notes using the delete button.<br>
